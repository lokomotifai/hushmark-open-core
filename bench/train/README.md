# hushmark-tr training pipeline

Generated data and checkpoints stay under the ignored `bench/train/outputs/` directory. The
normal workspace lock intentionally installs CPU Torch; CUDA runs must use
[`scripts/bootstrap-gpu.sh`](../../scripts/bootstrap-gpu.sh) and invoke `.venv/bin/python`
directly afterward.

## Reproducible local smoke path

```bash
uv run python bench/train/synthesize.py --profile full --seed 20260809 --check
uv run python bench/train/train.py --smoke
uv run python bench/train/evaluate.py \
  --checkpoint bench/train/outputs/smoke-checkpoint \
  --report bench/train/outputs/smoke-verdict.json
```

Smoke mode uses exactly 200 deterministic examples after both the eight repetitions locked by
`hushmark-bench-v0` and the four repetitions reserved for development. It runs one CPU epoch with
the transformer encoder frozen. Smoke checkpoints are never adoption-eligible.

## Full synthetic preparation

```bash
uv run python bench/train/synthesize_dev.py \
  --output bench/train/outputs/synthetic-dev.jsonl
uv run python bench/train/synthesize.py \
  --profile full \
  --output bench/train/outputs/synthetic-full.jsonl
uv run python bench/train/prepare_gliner.py \
  --input bench/train/outputs/synthetic-full.jsonl \
  --source-format synthetic-full \
  --output bench/train/outputs/synthetic-full-gliner.jsonl
```

The development profile reserves 1,008 rows immediately after the 2,016 locked evaluation rows.
The `full` profile skips both ranges before yielding 200,592 examples. Full training rejects
evaluation/development source labels, colliding record IDs, and identical model-visible content.
The earlier `legacy` synthesis profile exists only to reproduce historical WP-10 evidence and must
not be used for a full run.

## AI4Privacy Turkish bootstrap (`net-required`, optional)

The adapter supports the current `pii-masking-openpii-1m` export schema (`source_text`, `language`,
and `privacy_mask` entries with `value`, `start`, `end`, and `label`) as well as the older
`text`/`entities` form. It filters non-Turkish rows, validates values and offsets, maps supported
semantic labels into the closed Hushmark NER taxonomy, and ignores unsupported deterministic
identifier labels.

```bash
uv run python bench/train/prepare_gliner.py \
  --input /approved/path/ai4privacy-tr.jsonl \
  --source-format ai4privacy \
  --output bench/train/outputs/ai4privacy-tr-gliner.jsonl
```

The dataset revision, CC-BY-4.0 attribution, source digest, export filter, and final row count must
be recorded with any run that uses it. External download is not part of required offline tests.

## GPU execution

The guarded full path freezes the text encoder by default, uses separate encoder/head learning
rates when it is deliberately unfrozen, applies warm-up plus linear decay, caps rare-label
oversampling, and evaluates NER-only development metrics every 100 steps. It atomically retains the
best development checkpoint and stops early after five non-improving validations. A max-step pilot
is mechanically ineligible. A full checkpoint becomes final-evaluation eligible only when its
development result improves NER macro strict-F1 by at least 0.05 with no per-type loss over 0.02;
the same binding rule is then applied once to the locked benchmark.
